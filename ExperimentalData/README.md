# Automatic-Extractor-of-Fusion-Geometry-Features-for-Cartography-Objects-in-Wemap
All of data is in the directiornary named ExperimentalData, and the area_experiments_proj2.shp is orinal data, and the Including_salienceAttribite.json and Weights_Entropy_Effectivevalue.json are data after running code named Factors_calculation_Fusion.

Automatic_extractor.pkl is the tranined model, you can use it and do not re-train it.

Chinese(中文):

原始数据：area_experiments_proj2.shp
计算和融合几何特征后的数据：Including_salienceAttribite.json 和 Weights_Entropy_Effectivevalue.json

已经训练好的模型：Automatic_extractor.pkl，直接在AutomaticExtractor1中使用，不需再次训练
